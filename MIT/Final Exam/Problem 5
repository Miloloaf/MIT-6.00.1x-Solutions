# Problem 5
# 15.0/15.0 points (graded)
# In this problem, you will implement a class according to the specifications in the template file usresident.py. The file contains a
# Person class similar to what you have seen in lecture and a USResident class (a subclass of Person). Person is already implemented for
# you and you will have to implement two methods of USResident.

# For example, the following code:
# a = USResident('Tim Beaver', 'citizen')
# print(a.getStatus())
# b = USResident('Tim Horton', 'non-resident')

# will print out:
# citizen
# ## will show that a ValueError was raised at a particular line

## DO NOT MODIFY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE Person CLASS ##
